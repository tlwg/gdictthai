1. Description
==============
GDictThai is a GTK+ English-Thai Dictionary. This project aims to develop a
simple E-T dictionary for GTK+/GNOME environment. The dictionary database is
taken from KDictThai, a KDE-based English-Thai Dictionary. 

2. Requirements
===============
GTK+ >= 2.4 and its dependencies (glib, pango, etc.)
DB3 >= 3.0

3. Known Issues
===============
3.1 The meaning showed is not formatted. Next version would be better.

4. Todos
========
4.1 Share dictionary with KDictThai and/or cetdict (they are identical, 
   I guess).
4.2 Better display of meaning.
4.3 Move to libglade. 
4.4 Use libicu32/libthai ?
